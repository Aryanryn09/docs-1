# 3.1 WasmEdge Plug-in System Introduction


WasmEdge adopts the plug-in system to custom WasmEdge according to their own needs. The plug-in system makes creating a new host function for WasmEdge easier because developers don't need to care about the internal structure and details of WasmEdge since the plug-in interface is abstracted.

## WasmEdge Currently Released Plug-ins

There are several plug-in releases with the WasmEdge official releases.
Please check the following table to check the release status and how to build from source with the plug-ins.

> The `WasmEdge-Process` plug-in is attached in the WasmEdge release tarballs.

> Due to the `OpenVINO` and `PyTorch` dependencies, we only release the WASI-NN plug-in on `Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64` now. We'll work with `manylinux2014` versions in the future.
